# Project Euler Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to problems from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/), written in **C++** and **Python**.

## Structure

- `cpp-solutions/` – Solutions written in C++
- `python-solutions/` – Solutions written in Python

Each solution is stored in its own folder under `cpp-solutions/` or `python-solutions/`, e.g., `cpp-solutions/problem-0001/main.cpp` or `python-solutions/problem-0001/main.py`.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer**: This repository contains only my own code. It does **not** reproduce any of the original problem statements, in accordance with Project Euler’s [terms of use](https://projecteuler.net/about).
