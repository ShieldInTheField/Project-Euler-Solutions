# Project Euler Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to problems from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/), written in **C++** and **Python**.

## Structure

- `cpp-solutions/` – Solutions written in C++
- `python-solutions/` – Solutions written in Python

Each file corresponds to a Project Euler problem, e.g., `problem-0001.cpp` or `problem-0001.py`.
